            <h2>About him!</h2>
            <p>
                Brandon Sanderson (born December 19, 1975) is an American author of epic fantasy and science fiction.
                <br>
                He is best known for the Cosmere fictional universe, in which most of his fantasy novels, most notably the Mistborn series and The Stormlight Archive, are set.
                <br>
                Outside of the Cosmere, he has written several young adults and juvenile series
                <br>
                including The Reckoners, the Skyward series, and the Alcatraz series. He is also known for finishing Robert Jordan's high fantasy series The Wheel of Time and
                <br>    
                has created several graphic novel fantasy series including the White Sand and Dark One.

            <h2>The Cosmere</h2>
            <p>
                The cosmere is the name of the universe in which Elantris, Mistborn, Warbreaker, The Stormlight Archive, White Sand, and stories contained in Arcanum Unbounded: The Cosmere Collection are all set.
                <br>
                This idea came from Sanderson's desire to create an epic-length series without requiring readers to buy a ridiculous number of books. 
                <br>    
                Because of that, he hides connections to his other works within each book, creating a "hidden epic". 
                <br>
                He has estimated that the cosmere sequence could conclude with at least 40 books.
                <br>
                The story of the cosmere is about a mysterious being called Adonalsium, 
                <br>    
                who existed on a world known as Yolen. Adonalsium was killed by a group of sixteen conspirators, 
                <br>
                causing its power to shatter into sixteen different Shards, each of which bears immense power.
                <br>    
                The sixteen people then took these Shards and traveled to new worlds, populating them with different systems of magic.
                <br>    
                In one case, the Shards Ruin and Preservation worked together to actually create a planet and its people (Scadrial, as featured in Mistborn).

            <h2>Laws Of Magic</h2>
            <p>
                The idea of hard magic and soft magic was popularized by Sanderson for world building and creating magic systems in fictional settings.
                <br>
                The terminology of hard and soft originate from hard and soft sciences,
                <br>
                hard science fiction, hard fantasy and soft science fiction and both terms are approximate ways of characterizing two ends of a spectrum.
                <br>
                Hard magic systems follow specific rules, the magic is controlled and explained to the reader in the narrative detailing the mechanics behind the way the magic 'works',
                <br>
                and can be used for building interesting worlds that revolve around the magic system. Soft magic systems may not have clearly defined rules or limitations, 
                <br>
                or provide limited exposition regarding their workings, and are used to create a sense of wonder to the reader.
                <br>
                Sanderson's three laws of magic are creative writing guidelines that can be used to create magic systems for fantasy stories.
                <br>
                An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.
                <br>
                1.	Weaknesses, limits and costs are more interesting than powers.
                2.	The author should expand on what is already a part of the magic
                <br>
                system before something entirely new is added, as this may otherwise entirely change how the magic system fits into the fictional world.
                <br>
                3.	Additionally, there is a zeroth law, Always err on the side of what's awesome.
